# Ames Housing Machine Learning Project

Hello house hunters! 

This project aims to understand relationships between house features and sale price for houses sold in 2006~2010 in Ames, IA. We use a variety of data analysis tools and machine learning algorithms to describe feature relationships and predict the sale price.

The dataset used in this project is from https://www.kaggle.com/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset?rvi=1.
